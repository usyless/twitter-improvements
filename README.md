# Features (or whatever lol)

Copy as VX/FX/Custom Button Thingy

Adds a mystical button that shoots tweet links into another dimension (or like, VXTwitter or FXTwitter or something idk). Great for flexing on other platforms or confusing your grandma.


Image Yoink Button

Puts a lil goblin in the top left of every pic who screams “DOWNLOAD TIME!” and slaps that image into your computer in 16K UltraMega definition with filenames that even Sherlock Holmes couldn’t reverse-engineer. Or could he?? Drama.


Video Steal Button

Smacks itself right next to the copy button like “hi lol” and lets you yoink every cursed video or gif in the tweet. Also names them like “banger_40982_finalfinal2.MP4” but in a cool way.


Download History (aka your FBI file)

Keeps a list of your crimes (aka downloaded stuff) and gently bonks you if you try to download the same meme twice. Can import/export like Pokémon cards but nerdier.


Hide Annoying Trash

Banishes premium and verified orgs into the void. No blue check? No problem.

Also rearranges buttons like it’s feng shui for your timeline.


Bookmark Button But Make It Giant

When you open a cursed image or video, boom, big ol’ bookmark button says “remember this horror forever.”


Everything is Toggleable Because We Love Chaos

Reverse Uno for Images/Videos

Upload that weird image you downloaded and it’ll sniff out the tweet it came from like a bloodhound with Wi-Fi.


Right Click Save Magic

Right click any image on Twitter and boom—save. Classic. Simple. No thoughts, just click
